# ANDGATE_SYNTHESIS_SIMULATION.
EXPERIMENT 1:- ANDGATE  LEVEL  MODELING.   LINK TO EDA PLAYGROUND ANDGATE SIMULATION :- https://www.edaplayground.com/x/cZgS
AIM:- TO LEARN AND-GATE LEVEL MODELING BY SIMUILATION AND SYNTHESIS PROCESS.
SOFTWARE REQUIRED ARE:- EDA PLAYGROUNDS AND GITHUB.
PROCESS/PROCEDURE:-1)OPEN THE GOOGLE SEARCH ENGINE AND TYPE “github.com/vision-vlsi”.
2)Now on the right side of the “OVERVIEW” we see the option “REPOSITORIES” 
FIG2 SHOWS REPOSITORIES OPTION
3)NOW CLICK ON REPOSITORIES AND WE SEE A TERM VERILOG
4) NOW CLICK ON VERILOG AND WE SEE THE LIST OF CONTENT AS BELOW 
FIG4 SHOWS THE LIST OF CONTENT
5)NOW CLICK ON “COMBINATIONAL CIRCUITS” FROM THE CONTENT LIST 
FIG5 SHOWS THE COMBINATIONAL CIRCUIT OPTION
6) AS WE CLICK ON COMBINATIONAL CIRCUIT WE GET THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF GATE MODELLING
FIG6 SHOWS THE LEVEL MODELING
7) NOW CLICK ON 2 GATE LEVEL MODELLING AND WE GET THE LIST OF GATES WHICH WE WANT TO DO SIMULATION 
FIG7 SHOWS THE LIST OF GATES FOR SIMULATION
9)NOW CLICK ON ANDGATE AS WE CLICK ON ANDGATE WE GET THE DESIGN CODE AND TESTBENCH CODE FOR ANDGATE STIMULATION  
FIG8 SHOWS THE DESIGN AND TESTBENCH CODE
10)AS WE OPEN/CLICK THE ANDGATE DESIGN CODE WE THE THE CODE AS FOLLOWS
FIG10 SHOWS THE CODE FOR DESIGN OF ANDGATE
11) NOW COPPY THE CODE AND PASTE IT INTO THE EDAPLAYGROUND IN DESIGNSV PART
FIG11 SHOWS THE CODE IN EDA PLAYGROUND DESIGN.SV
12)NOW GO BACK TO THE GITHUB AND CLICK ON ANDGATE_TESTBENCH.SV 
FIG12 SHOWS THE ANDGATE TEST_ DESIGN.SV CODE
13)AS WE GO TO ANDGATE_TB.V WE GET THER CODE AND WE SHOULD COOPYTHE TESTBENCH.V CODE TO EDAPLAYGROUND TESTBENCH.V  SESION
FIG13 SHOWS THE TESTBENCH.V CODE IN GITHUB 
FIG13 SHOWS THE CODE IN TESTBENCH.SV IN EDAPLAYGROUNDS. 
15)NOW IN EDAPLAYGROUNDS SAVE THE CODE AND SELECT THE SIMULATION TOOL FOR SIMULATION  
FIG15 SHOWS THE SIMULATION TOOL WHICH WE HAVE USED FOR SIMULATION
16)NOW AGAIN SAVE THE CODE. AND CLICK ON RUN OPTION ON THE UPPER LEFT SIDE OF THE EDAPLAYGROUNDS 
FIG16 SHOWS THE RUN OPTION
17)WE GET THE WAVEFORM AS FOLLOWS
FIG17 SHOWS THE WAVEFORM
RESULT:- THEREFORE WE GET A EP WAVE OF THE ANDGATE SIMULATION.


EXPERIMENT-2:-  SYNTHESIS OF THE ANDGATE  
AIM:-  To LEARN THE SYNTHESIS OF ANDGATE.   https://www.edaplayground.com/x/cZgS
SOFTWARE REQUIRED:-  GITHUB AND EDA PLAYGROUND.
PROCESS/PROCEDURE:- * REPEAT THE SAME PROCESS TILL COPPYING THE DESIGN.SV AND TESTBENCH.SV CODES FROM GITHUB AND PASTE IT IN THE EDAPLAYGROUNDS IN RESPECTIVE AREAS.

1)	NOW AFTER SAVING THE CODE LETS NOW SELECT THE SYNTHESIS TOOL
 
FIG2 SHOWS THE SYNTHESIS TOOL
3)NOW SAVE THE CODE AND RUN THE CODE 
OUTPUT:- https://www.edaplayground.com/getFile?id=66f0a5c7-9505-41dc-816b-6b0dd93a9d14&type=svg
  
THEREFORE WE GET THE SYNTHESIS OF THE ANDGATE.
